			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experimenting with assigning strings, numbers, and boolean values to variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When using console in the browser, I was having trouble getting console.log()
						to work. It turns out it was because of the browser I was using and when I 
						switched over to Chrome, everything worked fine, so I redid the console part
						of the assignment.
						 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The basics of JavaScript and Python are pretty similar, so this was pretty easy
						to pick up. I've also used JS a little bit before, it's just when it starts 
						getting more complicated when I'll have more trouble with the programming part
						of the assignment. </p>
