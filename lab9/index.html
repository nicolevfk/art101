                <p>In this lab we used jQuery to create buttons that affect our html file.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section" id="problem">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>The biggest problem I encountered during this lab was figuring out how to make the 
                    same code work for each of the buttons individually without affecting eachother (task X). 
                    I thought I was doing what the instructions said, and no errors were showing in the 
                    console. I then figured out that I wrote the wrong class, so the js wasn't understanding 
                    what I was trying to click all-together. Once I changed that, my code worked again.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section" id="result">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>When you press the buttons, it toggles the CSS of the section.</p>
