                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>The hardest part of this assignment was displaying text on the right in task X. In order 
                    to switch between 2 different classes, I tried to use toggleClass, but couldn't figure 
                    it out, so instead I used an if-else statement using a variable that switched between 
                    true/false. Once that was done, I was still having trouble figuring out the CSS to display 
                    and inline-block on the right. I tried using float, but that would make the next message
                    appear in the same line which isn't what we wanted. In the end I looked it up and found 
                    an answer that worked on StackOverflow using "transform: translateX(-100%)," to flip how
                    everything was styled.
