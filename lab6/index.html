					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experiment with arrays and ojects in JavaScript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some troubles when creating the object, specifically the part when we created
						the 'age' function. It kept on giving me errors until I imputed it exactly how it 
						should be imputed. And then I also had some trouble calling the function as it kept
						on showing the whole function instead of just the result of the function. Then I 
						figured out I had to put () at the end of myMainRide.age for it to actually call the
						function. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The result of my code is below.</p>
