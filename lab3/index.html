			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges of this lab were identifying the local file structure in our 
						repository and making connections between our labs and homepage using links.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There weren't many problems with this lab since it felt fairly simple. The 
						hardest part was trying to write out the responses to all these questions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>While this lab wasn't very difficult, I still spent time making my pages look
						nice. If anything, how easy this lab was made me spend more time on aesthetics
						(both in this lab and on my homepage). </p>
