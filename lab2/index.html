				<h2>A Bit About Me...</h2>
				<p>My name is Nicole. I am a 4th-year AGPM major. In my major, I like making a lot of analog games, 
					so board games and card games. Although I've taken some programming classes (mainly in Python), I 
					don't think I'm very good at it. In this class I want to improve my programming skills so I feel 
					more confident when coding. 
				</p>

				<p>So far classes have been going well. I have this class as my only class on Mondays, Wednesdays and 
					Fridays and all my other classes are in a row on Tuesday and Thursday. I start with my Game Design 
					class from 3:20 to 4:55, then a Character Creation class from 5:20 to 6:55, and finally section for 
					this class from 7:10 until whenever it's over. Lots of fun, lots of work. I've also been doing the 
					Inktober challenge meaning I draw every day. Usually this just results in me staying up to late drawing. 
					I could stop at any time, but I also just want the practice. In addition to drawing every day, I've 
					been trying to make my drawing a full body figure using references I've found on Pintrest. Although 
					it's a lot of work, I feel like I have been improving, so it's worth it in a way.

			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we had to edit HTML and CSS files in order to make an 
						introductory page for ourselves and our partner.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We struggled to figure out how to work together while working on different 
						files. In the end, rather than creating the exact same project, we both worked 
						individually on our own projects and helped each other out whenever we got stuck 
						on something. Some examples of this were us figuring out how to replicate the 
						formatting style already existing on the HTML file, figuring out how to format 
						our paragraphs (including going to a new line with br /), and suggesting ways to 
						find color palettes for the final touch. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I enjoyed this project because I got to experiment a bit with HTML and CSS when I 
						actually knew what I was doing. I took another class sophomore year where, during
						one project, I had to use a software that used HTML/CSS/JS, but I had no idea what 
						I was doing so the result was pretty basic. A large portion of the class were CSGD
						majors, so I felt a bit out of place as an AGPM major. From a beginners perspective,
						it can look a bit scary, but HTML and CSS isn't that complicated once you learn a 
						bit about it (at least compared to some of the other software I've had to learn). </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
					<p>I like my final result. I added a png of a planet because that's the vibe I was 
						getting from my color palette. I would have liked to put it next to my text rather
						rather than separating it, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet. Some of my 
						favorite things I learned were how to indent and align text. I'm not a fan of when 
						text is all aligned to the left because I think it looks boring, so I wanted to change 
						that on my page. </p>
