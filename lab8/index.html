                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I had difficulty using script output to print everything I wanted it to print. When I seperated
                        things using commas, like I often do with strings, it would either print the first part of the
                        string or (when I surrounded it with parentheses) the last part of the string. When I replaced 
                        the commas with +, everything worked. I don't know why that was an issue specifically with this
                        string, but I fixed it. I wish there were spaces between the spaces and numbers/strings, but that
                        would be a lot of work to fix. </p>
