			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we had to come up with step by step processes for completing a 
						couple tasks. The hardest part was coming up with which tasks we should do
						and then how detailed the intructions should be. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that arose was how to format the sublist for each step in our
						pseudocode outline. I ended up creating an ordered list inside an ordered 
						list and using CSS I made it so any ordered list inside an ordered list 
						would use Roman numerals instead of numbers so it would be less confusing. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I enjoyed working on this assignment with my partner. It felt like we were
						able to speed through it quickly, and then I spent some time sprucing up my 
						page with colors and images. </p>

									<li>Get ingredients</li>

										<li>2 cups of flour</li>
										<li>2 large eggs</li>
										<li>3 egg yolks</li>
									</ol>
									<li>Form pasta dough</li>
									<ol>
										<li>Make well with flour</li>
										<li>Add eggs to flour and mix with fork </li>
										<li>knead dough for 8-10 mins</li>
										<li>Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes</li>
									</ol>
									<li>Roll out dough</li>
									<ol>
										<li>Using a pasta machine or rolling pin, roll the dough out lengthwise slightly</li>
										<li>On a lightly floured surface, fold the pasta dough in thirds</li>
										<li>Repeat these 2 steps until the pasta dough is smooth</li>
										<li>Now roll the dough out until it is around 1/16 inch thick</li>
									</ol>
									<li>Cut into pasta shape</li>
									<ol>
										<li>Cut pasta into sheets, around 12-14 inches long</li>
									<li>Dust both sides of the dough with flour</li>
									<li>After cutting to desired shape, stack pasta to the side and cover with a clean, 
										dampened kitchen towel</li>
