                <p>Debug any code from previous labs that didn't work as expected. </p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>It was pretty to correct what I had problems with in the previous labs. The biggest problem I
                    encountered while debugging was in lab 8 when I was trying to figure out how to start/end the string
                    without a comma. I ended up making it so the first loop of the for loop set the string variable
                    as the first item in the list, and then from there each loop adds a comma, space, and then the
                    following item on the list. This way, the list doesn't have an unwanted comma on either side of 
                    the list. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The labs I worked to fix were labs 8 and 12 as explained below in the Debugging section. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <div class="side-by-side">
					<div class="left-side">
                        <b>Before: </b>
						<img id="lab8-b" src="img/lab8-before.png"/>
					</div>
					<div class="right-side">
                        <b>After: </b>
						<img id="lab8-a" src="img/lab8-after.png"/>	
					</div>
                    <p>In lab 8, all the values were printed without spaces inbetween which made it difficult
                        to read, so I used a for loop to make a function that would space the lists before
                        outputting them. 
                    </p> </br> </br>
                    <div class="left-side">
                        <b>Before: </b>
						<img id="lab12-b" src="img/lab12-before.png"/>
					</div>
					<div class="right-side">
                        <b>After: </b>
						<img id="lab12-a" src="img/lab12-after.png"/>	
					</div>
                    <p>In lab 12, I didn't check to make sure there was an input so if the input was left 
                        blank the function would automatically output Griffindor. I fixed this by checking 
                        to see if there is an input, and if there isn't, the function outputs a string telling the 
                        user to input their name. 
                    </p>
